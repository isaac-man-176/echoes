## 🌟 What is Echoes?

Echoes is a platform where people share authentic life experiences, not just success stories. It's designed for students and young professionals navigating important life decisions, providing real insights from those who've walked similar paths.

**The Problem:** Most advice comes from highly accomplished professionals whose journeys feel distant and unrelatable. Echoes brings you stories from people currently in the trenches.

**The Solution:** A space where everyone can share their "echo" - the messy, uncertain, in-progress stories that most of us are actually living.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 AI-Powered Search**: Intelligent search that understands context and finds relevant experiences using natural language queries
- **📱 Modern Interface**: Beautiful gradient animations, smooth transitions, and fully responsive design
- **🎯 Core Functionalities**: Share experiences, browse recent submissions, and find specific stories using AI-powered search
- **🤖 AI Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini AI for semantic search, context understanding, and intelligent matching between user queries and existing echoes
